### How to set up the TrafficSense system:
1. Install inductive wires under asphalt where cars would wait for the light to turn green, marked B1, B2 to detect for idling cars
2. Install a motion sensor on the closest traffic light monitoring the approximate area marked S to detect passing cars
3. Connect inductive wires & sensors to microcontroller system in every pair of traffic lights as shown in the diagram
4. Replicate steps 1-3 for the remaining pairs of lanes to complete the intersection
